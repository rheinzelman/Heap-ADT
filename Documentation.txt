Terminal Output:

Average of all values in vector1: 476.99
Pushing meanValue into heap...

Popping max value out of heap...
The max value of the heap is now: 963

Report:
The heap was created through the use of vectors and their begin() and end() functionality.
each time a change was made to the heap, push_heap() to reorder the elements.
I attempted to try and create an alogrithm that would print a heap no matter the size,
but I quickly discovered that it is a fairly difficult challenge and the project specs do not call
for that functionality so I did not implement it.
